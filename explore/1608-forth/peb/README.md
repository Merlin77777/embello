The µC is an ARM Cortex M3 @ 72 MHz with 64 KB RAM and 512 KB flash.

On-board SRAM, serial USB, µSD socket, RS232, A/D and D/A, 7-seg LED, CAN,
RS485, 4 buttons, 8 LEDs, trimpot, 240x320 LCD, DS18B20, IR receiver, JTAG,
accelerometer, buzzer, nRF24L01 and ESP8266 headers, SPI flash, I2C EEPROM.

[Schematic](schematic.pdf) (most text is in Chinese but "guessable").

All pins seem to be allocated, but are brought out on headers, several jumpers.
